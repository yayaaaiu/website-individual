I also joined a Netball Team once and represent the school in one event conducted by the parties involved.

The reason why is because I joined the club abruptly when my teacher offered this in class for anyone who wanted to join this club when I was 9 years old (year 3), without knowing anything at all about this club. Serious talk, I was speechless when I go to the first training because it was intense, we had to run, jump and a lot more to evaluate if we are suitable enough to join this club. Luckily, I managed to pass the evaluation and able to be a part of the sports' club until the last year of primary school which is year 6. Other than that, I am one of the best track athlete after lots of training and was able to represent the school in many running events and won almost all of them</td>

Other than that, I managed to get the responsibilites as school prefect again from form 2 until form 5 since I had the experience of being one during primary school. Being the school prefect when in primary school was way different than in high school because some seniors were ridiculously hard to control since they think they are the oldest in the school.

My batch (2002) were the first batch that inaugurate this club in 2015 when we were 13 years old. We were specifically chosed by the school principal because we were in the first and second class. In addition to that, I was a member in this club until form 5 where I have to teach and guide new members on how to play angklung, read the music note correctly, and a lot more. We always got invited by people that give us the opportunity to perform and play angklung in many places. In my opinion, this is because angklung is one of the interesting way to entertain people since it is rare to see students play instrument like angklung in school.</td>
