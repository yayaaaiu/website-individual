                I was transfered to school in Putrajaya from Langkawi when I was 9 years old (Year 3). This is because I have to follow my mother who got transfered to Putrajaya for her work. I finished the remaining years of primary school in this school which is Sekolah Kebangsaan Putrajaya Presint 14 (1) or more known as SK PP 14 (1) there. This school is located right in front of my house where my siblings and I just have to walk to school. It takes less than 10 minutes to arrive so we did not have to be rush. This school hold many memories that are precious to me since I met my friends there, involved in various things like being school prefect and athlete and a lot more. I also took my UPSR here with a result of 3A's and 2B's. I am always grateful that I get to receive education here since all teachers are so kind and the school facilities are all in good condition. Below is the picture of the school.

                After finishing my primary school at SK PP 14 (1), I moved to SMK PP 14 (1) or Sekolah Kebangsaan Putrajaya Presint 14 (1). This school is located next to the primary school which I only have to walk to go to school. I completed my studies from form 1 until form 5 there where I got my PT3 and SPM certificate. Luckily for PT3, I managed to get 8A's and for SPM, I got 5A's. I took accounting course during form 4 and form 5 that are cumpolsory for us to further studies later. There are lots of things and experience I get from this school that are beneficial for me to get through life after completing school. As I have mentioned before, I am always grateful that I get to receive education here since all teachers are so kind and the school facilities are all in good condition. Below is the picture of the school.

                Then, I furthered my studies in UiTM Rembau, Negeri Sembilan. The program offered for me is Diploma in Information Management (IM110) where I am already in my final semester that will end this february. When I first heard about this program, I was unsure if I can continue my studies with this program but it really made me happy since we have learned about library, archive, museum and more specifically in managing information. After learning, I got interested to continue seeking knowledge about archive management if I can continue my studies with a degree later. As always, I got a lot of experience while I am here since I got to meet various types of people with different personalities and attitude. Luckily, I managed to get through Diploma life after countless ups and downs. Below is the pictures of UiTM Rembau.
